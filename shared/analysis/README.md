## Analysis

* `model_analysis.py`: a file that contains the functions to measure the rheobase and the voltage threshold in current-clamp 
(with or without voltage-clamping the soma before the pulse) and to measure the voltage threshold in voltage-clamp.

* `trace_analysis.py`: a file that contains functions to analyse the shape and the time course of action potentials recorded in current-clamp.
