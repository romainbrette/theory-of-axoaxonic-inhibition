## Models

* `model_Na_Kv1.py`: a simple biophysical model of an action potential,
with Na channels activation and inactivation, and Kv1-like channels activation.
The AIS contains a high density of both channels and the rest of the neuron a much lower density of both channels.

* `model_Na_Kv1.py_GABA`: same model with a synaptic conductance.

* `model_Na_Kv1.py_extended_GABA`: same model with a spatially distributed synaptic conductance.

* `params_model_description`: the parameters used with the biophysical model of the AP.
